# Studies Mini-Projects

Collection of simple programs made during my studies to explore some of the concepts that appeared in lectures.
This repository will probably grow with more examples until the end of my studies.

### Example modules:
    - three different implementations of Hanoi tower with time comparison
    - simple binary tree implementation
    - heap and beap implementation

## Usage

### Customisation:

To choose desired module to run just edit main.cpp file and turn on or off one of the flags placed on beginning of the file. Remember to check **xxxMain.h** files inside include directory, which contains specific information about module.

### Compilation:

Just use any preffered C++ compiler to compile main.cpp file, probably with optimisations enabled e.g.

```sh
g++ -O3 main.cpp -o MyProgram
```
